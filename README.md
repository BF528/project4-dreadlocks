# Project Description
The goal of this project is to replicate the primary findings the study A Single-Cell Transcriptomic Map of the Human and Mouse Pancreas Reveals Inter- and Intra-cell Population Structure authored by Baron et al using current analytical methodology and software packages by analyzing sequencing data from one of the four human donors (donor 2). We utilized a graph-based clustering method different from the original authors and identified six major pancreatic cell types characterized by different transcriptional expression profiles, four of which confirmed by gene set enrichment analysis results.
